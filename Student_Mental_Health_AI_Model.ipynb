And, with an estimated 20-50% annual increase of university students seeking help for studies-related mental health issues, it's clear that we're under more pressure than ever before. So, here to your rescue are seven tips to help you through the stressful exam period.1. Remember to breathe\\nSetting aside a couple of minutes every day to practice mindfulness techniques, such as breathing exercises or UCL's 10 Minute Mind, helps you to calm down your body's stress response and shift your attention back to the present moment. In turn, this gives you time to rationally think through the anxieties you have, rid yourself of unhelpful thought patterns and enables you to deal with a large number of exams and begin more effective revision.2.\\xa0Eat, sleep and exercise well\\nPulling all-nighters, surviving on a poor diet, and getting minimal amounts of movement into your day can increase symptoms of anxiety. For your body's best performance, make sure you're getting 8/9 hours of sleep, enough slow-release carbs, less caffeine and more water, and at least half an hour of exercise per day.\\n3.\\xa0Set realistic goals\\nSetting realistic goals, whether you have several weeks, days or hours before your exam, helps you to put everything into perspective. Acceptance of your situation and working within the realms of what you have maximises your productivity without the risk of burning yourself out.\\n4.\\xa0Don't go it alone\\nIn 2004, a research paper published in Linguistics and Education saw that revising with peers is an effective study technique as it allows individuals to better absorb their own notes. Furthermore, the emotional benefits of social support tend to include a better sense of confidence and autonomy.5.\\xa0Pace yourself through panic\\nPanicking before, during or even after an exam is common among university students. If you experience it at any point, take six deep breaths, hydrate yourself, and then go back the problem at hand, being sure to break it down into several, manageable chunks. Remember that there is usually a rational solution to every problem, even if you can't see it at first glance.\\n6.\\xa0Believe in yourself\\nWhen being constantly faced with new challenges, we often forget to look back at how far we have come and how much we have already achieved. Given that you have prepared well, there should be no reason for you to worry. Therefore, when experiencing a negative thought, try to replace it with a positive one. For example, instead of thinking 'If I don't get at least a 2:1, I am a failure', think 'Whatever I get, I will be proud of myself and value how much I have already achieved'. You can do this!\\n7.\\xa0If you feel like you are struggling, talk to someone\\nAsking for help is never shameful. In the most extreme cases, it can help save a life. When struggling, talk to friends, family, or your personal tutor about how you are feeling. Alternatively, don't be afraid to seek professional help and support.\\nGood luck, everyone!Maryam Clark is a Biosciences PhD student at the UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences and is a student journalist for myUCL.\\nUseful links\\nUCL Student Support & Wellbeing's exam success guide\\nUCL Student Psychological Services' tips for dealing with exam anxiety\\nUCL and external support\\nMind (mental health charity)\\nSamaritans (mental health charity)Maryam Clark, myUCL Student JournalistShareTweetFollow usInformation forCurrent students\\nStaff\\nAlumni\\nBusiness\\nDonorsVisitMaps\\nLibrary, museums and collections\\nBloomsbury Theatre\\nUCL East\\nTours and visitsConnect with UCLJobs\\nMedia Relations\\nEvents\\nUCL and London\\nUCL ShopUniversity College London,\\xa0Gower Street,\\xa0London,\\xa0WC1E 6BT\\xa0Tel:\\xa0+44\\xa0(0)\\xa020 7679 2000Copyright © 2024 UCL\\nDisclaimer\\nFreedom of Information\\nAccessibility\\nPrivacy and Cookies\\nSlavery statement\\nContact Us\",\n",

A bit of stress can help you to stay motivated and focused. But too much can be unhelpful.Exam stress can be overwhelming. It can confuse and exhaust you. Having to revise a lot of information in a short space of time can be stressful. Not understanding course material may also add to your stress.If it all seems to be getting on top of you, there are things you can do to keep calm.Keep a routine and take regular breaksIt's important to have regular study breaks and make time for relaxation and exercise.Practising mindfulness helps you focus on what's happening right at this moment.Going for a walk, run, or to the gym is a great way to clear your head and can help you focus.Watching your favourite TV show or going to the cinema are also good ways to take a break from studying.Stress - tips and self-helpPhysical activity and mental healthLimit caffeineCaffeine and energy drinks can give you a quick lift. But they're not good for you in the long term.They can make you feel sick and can interfere with your sleep and your ability to concentrate.Manage expectationsPressure from other people around exams can be huge. This can be hard to deal with, especially from family and teachers. You need to remember that it's your life and your exam, with you in control.Tips to help you manage expectationsStressful situations may cause you to worry too much and imagine the worst possible outcome. Base expectations on your past performance and doing the best you can.Put the exam in context. In the overall scheme of things, how important is it?Tell people what you realistically expect from your exams. Talk to them and find out what they hope for you. Tell them what you are thinking and feeling.Use the expectations of yourself and others to help you study.Ask for and accept support from those around you, especially family members.If exams do not go as well as you hoped, there are always alternatives. It does not mean you are a success or failure.Exams cannot measure these sorts of things. All they measure is how well you do on the day.Look after yourselfIt's easy to let exams get on top of you and forget to look after yourself. If possible, try to get good night's sleep every night. It's a good time to make an effort to eat healthily, making sure you eat plenty of fruit and vegetables.Eating healthilyAsk for and accept supportIf you're feeling overwhelmed, you might find it helpful to talk to a teacher or counsellor. It's also important to ask for or accept support from your family.This support might be practical, like picking you up from the library. It could also be emotional support, including advice.If you need to talk to someone outside the situation, you can call:Childline on 1800 66 66 66Samaritans on 116 123Options for the futureIf you are doing the Leaving Certificate, getting the exam results you need for your first preference is great. But it's not the end of the world if you do not. There are often other ways to get into the area you are interested in studying and working in.It may mean taking a year out and getting some practical experience or doing a further education course. You might consider repeating. If you do accept another offer, you may find that you like it or it suits you better.Leave the stress in the exam hallThere's always a light at the end of the tunnel. Exams have a beginning and an end. The stress that goes along with them should end with the exam.Once the exam is over, there's nothing more you can do about it. You should just try to relax afterwards.Page last reviewed: 1 September 2022Next review due: 1 September 2025HSE Live - we're here to helpMonday to Friday: 8am to 8pmSaturday: 9am to 5pmSunday: ClosedBank holidays: ClosedFreephone: 1800 700 700From outside Ireland: +353 1 240 8787HSE FacebookHSE InstagramHSE TikTokHSE YouTubeHSE LinkedInHSE X (Twitter)Complaints and feedback\\nEmergenciesCookie settingsSupport linksCookie statement\\nAccessibility\\nPrivacy statement\\nDisclaimer© Health Service Executive\",\n",

Discover strategies that can help put you on the path to success.Source: Health ServicesOn this page:Signs and symptoms of exam stress\\nCauses of exam stress\\nStrategies that can help\\nAdditional resourcesExam stress is the feeling of tension and worry that comes from test-taking situations. It is normal to feel some stress about upcoming tests, exams, papers or presentations. Indeed, a small amount of stress can challenge you and stimulate you to work harder. Exam stress becomes problematic when it interferes with your ability to perform and achieve your academic and learning goals.\\nSigns and symptoms of exam stress\\nBelow are some signs that indicate you may be experiencing exam stress:Physical signs include a fast heartbeat, tense muscles, headache, sweating, upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth and difficulty sleeping.\\nBehavioural signs include fidgeting, nail biting, and increased smoking, drinking or eating.\\nMental and emotional signs include difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts, \"going blank,\" worry, and uncontrolled feelings of fear, dread or helplessness.Causes of exam stress\\nExam stress can develop for many different reasons. Knowing the reason(s) for your stress helps you identify strategies to manage it. Causes can be placed into four main categories:\\n1. Lifestyle issuesInadequate sleep\\nPoor nutrition\\nStimulant use (e.g., caffeine, energy drinks)\\nInsufficient exercise\\nNot scheduling available time\\nNot prioritizing commitments2. Information needsLack of exam-taking strategies\\nLack of academic information (e.g., course requirements, lecturers\\' expectations, exam dates and exam location)\\nLack of knowledge of how to apply stress reduction techniques while studying, before an exam and during an exam3. Poor studying stylesInefficient studying (e.g., inconsistent content coverage, trying to memorize the textbook, binge studying, all-night studying)\\nIneffective studying (e.g., reading without understanding, cannot recall the material, not making study/review notes, not studying/reviewing)4. Psychological factorsFeeling little or no control over the exam situation\\nNegative thinking and self-criticism; for example:\\n\"I am not smart enough.\"\\n\"I’ll get a terrible grade.\"\\n\"I won’t pass this exam.\"\\n\"I can\\'t do this.\"Irrational thinking about exams and outcomes\\nIrrational beliefs; for example:\\n\"If I don’t pass, my family/boyfriend/girlfriend/friends will lose respect for me.\"\\n\"I will never get a degree.\"Irrational demands; for example:\\n\"I have to get at least an A or I am worthless.\"Catastrophic predictions; for example:\\n\"I’ll fail no matter what I do — there’s no point.\"Strategies that can help\\nThe most effective way to reduce exam stress combines skill-focused approaches (e.g., building your study skills) with behaviour or cognitive approaches (e.g., learning stress management strategies).\\nWhen you have identified the cause of your exam stress, you need to ask additional questions to help you decide what intervention will be most helpful. For example, if you recognize that you were not sufficiently prepared, ask yourself:Why was I not prepared? Was it because I did not have enough time to study? Did I not understand the material?\\nIf I did not have sufficient time, why not? Because of other course work, family responsibilities, a job, watching television?You can see how critical it is to thoroughly examine the causes of your experience! How you address your experience of exam stress will be very different, depending upon what you discover. Some ways to reduce exam stress include:\\nImprove your study and exam-taking skills\\nEffective preparation for an exam requires going beyond reading the material several times and making notes. There are numerous study and exam-taking skills you can develop and use to help you succeed. Concordia\\'s Student Learning Services offers a great deal of support that includes:skill-building workshops\\nindividual, tailored counselling with Learning Specialists\\nhelpful information on the Student Learning Services websiteChange negative thinking patterns\\nSome people see exams as a threat and thoughts about them are predominantly negative ones. These include thoughts like:\"I don\\'t understand this stuff.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure to fail this stupid exam.\"\\n\"What was I thinking when I took this course?\"These negative thoughts can lead to stress. Switching to a positive frame of mind can help to reduce stress. Pay close attention to your thoughts. When you hear yourself thinking negatively before or during an exam, stop and actively take a new perspective.\\nA technique called cognitive restructuring can be helpful in changing ineffective thinking. Learn more about cognitive restructuring here.\\nLearn to relax\\nStress can affect you physically by creating tension in your body. Many people find that applying relaxation techniques is beneficial. The simplest of these techniques is deep breathing. One technique is to slowly and deeply inhale through your nose for a count of four, hold the breath for a count of seven and then exhale slowly though pursed lips for a count of eight. Do this four times in a row. With each exhalation, imagine your worries leaving your body. Do this a couple of times while studying, as well as before and during your exam to release tension.\\nOther relaxation techniques include progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, yoga and Tai-chi. Learn more about relaxation techniques here.\\nTalk things out with a professional\\nSome people find it difficult to identify the root of their stress and could benefit by speaking with a mental health professional. At Concordia, Counselling and Psychological Services offers appointments with professionals where students can explore the factors related to their exam stress and find ways to overcome them.\\nEngage in healthy behaviours\\nEating healthfully, engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding tobacco and other positive health behaviours contribute to better health, which helps to buffer against the effects of stress.\\nFor more information, explore the variety of health topics on the Health Services website or speak to a Health Promotion Specialist.Additional resourcesInformation from Concordia University to help with exam stress: The Exams page has \"all the information you need to ace your exams\". Set yourself up for success by getting familiar with scheduling, rules and study tools.\\nExam Anxiety Workshop is a video that provides a comprehensive look at exam stress and strategies to manage it\\nCrash Course Study Skills is a YouTube playlist with 11 videos about study skills such as note taking, studying for exams and test anxiety\\nMastering Exam Anxiety\\xa0resources from Athabasca UniversityBack to stress managementBack to topBack to top© Concordia UniversityAboutAcademicsAdmissionsCampus lifeResearchInternationalCareersFuture studentsCurrent studentsAlumni & friendsParentsFaculty & staffMediaSir George Williams Campus\\n1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W.Montreal, Quebec, CanadaH3G 1M8See SGW Campus mapLoyola Campus\\n7141 Sherbrooke Street W.Montreal, Quebec, CanadaH4B 1R6See Loyola Campus mapCentral 514-848-2424 | Emergency 514-848-3717Safety & prevention|Accessibility|Privacy|Terms|Cookie settings|Contact us|Site feedback© Concordia University.Montreal, QC, Canada']"

And, with an estimated 20-50% annual increase of university students seeking help for studies-related mental health issues, it's clear that we're under more pressure than ever before. So, here to your rescue are seven tips to help you through the stressful exam period.1. Remember to breathe\\nSetting aside a couple of minutes every day to practice mindfulness techniques, such as breathing exercises or UCL's 10 Minute Mind, helps you to calm down your body's stress response and shift your attention back to the present moment. In turn, this gives you time to rationally think through the anxieties you have, rid yourself of unhelpful thought patterns and enables you to deal with a large number of exams and begin more effective revision.2.\\xa0Eat, sleep and exercise well\\nPulling all-nighters, surviving on a poor diet, and getting minimal amounts of movement into your day can increase symptoms of anxiety. For your body's best performance, make sure you're getting 8/9 hours of sleep, enough slow-release carbs, less caffeine and more water, and at least half an hour of exercise per day.\\n3.\\xa0Set realistic goals\\nSetting realistic goals, whether you have several weeks, days or hours before your exam, helps you to put everything into perspective. Acceptance of your situation and working within the realms of what you have maximises your productivity without the risk of burning yourself out.\\n4.\\xa0Don't go it alone\\nIn 2004, a research paper published in Linguistics and Education saw that revising with peers is an effective study technique as it allows individuals to better absorb their own notes. Furthermore, the emotional benefits of social support tend to include a better sense of confidence and autonomy.5.\\xa0Pace yourself through panic\\nPanicking before, during or even after an exam is common among university students. If you experience it at any point, take six deep breaths, hydrate yourself, and then go back the problem at hand, being sure to break it down into several, manageable chunks. Remember that there is usually a rational solution to every problem, even if you can't see it at first glance.\\n6.\\xa0Believe in yourself\\nWhen being constantly faced with new challenges, we often forget to look back at how far we have come and how much we have already achieved. Given that you have prepared well, there should be no reason for you to worry. Therefore, when experiencing a negative thought, try to replace it with a positive one. For example, instead of thinking 'If I don't get at least a 2:1, I am a failure', think 'Whatever I get, I will be proud of myself and value how much I have already achieved'. You can do this!\\n7.\\xa0If you feel like you are struggling, talk to someone\\nAsking for help is never shameful. In the most extreme cases, it can help save a life. When struggling, talk to friends, family, or your personal tutor about how you are feeling. Alternatively, don't be afraid to seek professional help and support.\\nGood luck, everyone!Maryam Clark is a Biosciences PhD student at the UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences and is a student journalist for myUCL.\\nUseful links\\nUCL Student Support & Wellbeing's exam success guide\\nUCL Student Psychological Services' tips for dealing with exam anxiety\\nUCL and external support\\nMind (mental health charity)\\nSamaritans (mental health charity)Maryam Clark, myUCL Student JournalistShareTweetFollow usInformation forCurrent students\\nStaff\\nAlumni\\nBusiness\\nDonorsVisitMaps\\nLibrary, museums and collections\\nBloomsbury Theatre\\nUCL East\\nTours and visitsConnect with UCLJobs\\nMedia Relations\\nEvents\\nUCL and London\\nUCL ShopUniversity College London,\\xa0Gower Street,\\xa0London,\\xa0WC1E 6BT\\xa0Tel:\\xa0+44\\xa0(0)\\xa020 7679 2000Copyright © 2024 UCL\\nDisclaimer\\nFreedom of Information\\nAccessibility\\nPrivacy and Cookies\\nSlavery statement\\nContact Us\""
